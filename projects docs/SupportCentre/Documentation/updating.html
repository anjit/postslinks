		<p>Welcome to the Update Guide. This guide is to help you update your system to the latest version. We know that a lot of our customers do their own custom updates to their systems and so having to overwrite their files all the time can sometimes cause them problems. This update guide is to show you which files need to be updated in order for your system to be fully updated.</p>

		<p><b>Version 1.8</b></p>
		<p>This update requires you to overwrite all files as it updates the entire system to longer rely on mod_rewrite to work. This update includes: </p>

		<ul>
		<li>Removed French Routes</li>
		<li>Fixed FileInfo Undefined Array</li>
		<li>Option to disable SEO URLs for Knowledge Base Articles (admin Panel)</li>
		<li>System Update: Now supports sites that don't have mod_rewrite or permission to use their own .htaccess files!</li>
		<li>Default Database option has been changed to mysqli (faster!)</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Files to Overwrite</b></p>
		<p>This update requires you to overwrite ALL files, including all views,controllers and models. Feel free to contact us if you have any issues.</p>
		<p>For users using mod_rewrite, you need to change your application/config/config.php line to:</p>
		<pre>$config['index_page'] = '';</pre>
		<p>This is now the default option for new installations.</p>

		<p><b>DATABASE UPDATE</b></p>
		<p>This update contains a change to the database tables. In order to make the system work, you will need to execute the update.sql found in updates/version1.8/update.sql. Just import this file into your database manager (like phpMyAdmin) and it should update your database tables for you.</p>

		<p><b>LANGUAGE UPDATE</b></p>
		<p>For those who have up-to-date language files, you will need to add some new lines to your language files in order to translate the new content being added. Follow the simple edits below:</p>

		<p>Modify file <b>application/language/english/admin_lang.php</b> (or replace english with the name of your language folder)</p>
		<p>Add the following lines of code to the bottom of your language file</p>
		<pre>
			$lang['pg_adm_6'] = "Disable Knowledge Base SEO URLs";
			$lang['pg_adm_7'] = "The system only supports SEO URLs with english characters (A-Z). Disable this option if you would prefer to use different characters in your Category names (but will make the category URLs use numbers instead of names).";
		</pre>

		<p><b>CLEAN INSTALL</b></p>
		<p>Remember, if you have trouble updating, you can always do a clean install. Just follow the guide in the Documentation Guide as you did before and you will have the latest version of the system ready.</p>
